# 📊 RFM Customer Segmentation Project

This project performs customer segmentation using the **RFM model** (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) and unsupervised learning techniques like **KMeans clustering**. The goal is to help businesses identify different types of customers (e.g., loyal customers, big spenders, or those at risk of churn) for personalized marketing strategies and data-driven decision-making.
